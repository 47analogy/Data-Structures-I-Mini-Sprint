# Data Structures I Mini 

In this mini sprint, you'll be exploring the different data structures that were introduced in the lecture. The main point of this mini sprint is to give you some exposure to these structures from the perspective of users before you have to go and implement them yourself in the actual sprint. 

This will mostly consist of you reading about these structures more in-depth, as well as interacting with them via their methods in order to get an understanding of what each method is doing.
